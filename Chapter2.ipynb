    "- Able to understand the characteristics of black and white daisies\n",
    "- Able to interpret the outcomes of the Daisyworld model on the temperature of a planet and how it supports the Gaia hypothesis\n",
    "- Understand how factors (e.g. daisy growth rate, daisy local temperature, daisy coverage, available ground, planet albedo, planet temperature) affect the Daisyworld\n",
    "- Recognise the strengths of modelling to observe numerous interactions within a system and appreciate its applications in real life\n",

    "#### PREAMBLE\n",
    "<p style='text-align: justify;'>\n",
    "In a simplistic Daisyworld model, we are only interested in black and white daisies, both of which have distinct impacts on the planet. The growth rate of daisies depends on the planet’s temperature, which in turn is modified by the daisies as they absorb differing amounts of solar radiation. As the daisies begin growing over time, the amount of available ground also decreases with time. We will discuss the single-colour model with solely white daisies and continue to cover the white-and-black daisy model via modelling practices.\n",

    "With reference to **Figure 1**, answer the following questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "a) What is the effect of white and black daisies on the temperature of the planet ?\n",
    "b) What are the differences between the roles of the black and white daisies in the model ?\n",
    "c) What do daisies, temperature luminosity, albedo in the Daisyworld represent in the actual biosphere ?\n",
    "d) Why does the number of white daisies affect the surface temperature in a negative, linear relationship ?\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Model answer**\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style='text-align: justify;'>\n",
    "a) Compared to the same area of barren soil (e.g., 0.4), vegetation with white daisies corresponds to a higher albedo (e.g., 0.7) and thereby higher reflection rate of light and lesser retention of heat. Therefore, white daisies have an effect that decreases the temperature of the planet; vice versa for black daisies, they tend to increase the temperature of the planet with their lower albedo as lesser amount of solar energy is reflected  due to their low albedo (e.g., 0.2). \n",
    "\n",
    "b) The two daisies have countering impacts on the temperature of the planet, if addressed in the same area of land. They represent different propensity of the planet’s temperature to change, as the equilibrium points of growth for the two daisies are not necessarily the same.  \n",
    "\n",
    "c) vegetations (daisies), temperature (climactic consequence), luminosity (activity of the Sun) and albedo (greenhouse effect or the albedo of Earth’s surface layers).\n",
    "\n",
    "d) This is only a representation of the relationship between white daisy coverage and temperature, which does not factor in the growth rate of daisies. Normally, a larger surface area is covered by white daisies; the closer the planet’s albedo leans towards that of the white daisy vegetation. Given the same solar flux-in, the more light will be reflected by daisies than barren ground ($albedo = {reflected \\ light \\over total \\ light}$) and therefore the more daisies there are, the more the temperature will be negatively affected. The relationship being linear involves the grey body premise where $F_{in} = A + B \\cdot T_p$ (A and B are coefficients that are empirically confirmed). \n",

    "<p style='text-align: justify;'>\n",
    "The surface temperature of the planet is dependent on the characteristics of daisies growing on the planet [2]. For example, white daisies reflect more incoming solar radiation back into the atmosphere. This reduces the amount of incoming solar radiation absorbed by the available ground, which in turn, reduces the surface temperature of the planet.\n",

    "The surface temperature response to daisy coverage in this negative coupling is implicitly implied by albedo, which reduces the capacity of the planet's surface to take up solar flux [2]. On the other hand, white daisies possess a parabolic growth curve to do with the local temperature. As such, the abundance of white daisies will become optimal when it is at the optimum temperature but decreases to zero when the temperature goes to the two extremities. Local temperature is the condition that caps the population size of white daisies.\n",
