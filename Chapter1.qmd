## 1 | OVERVIEW

#### LEARNING OBJECTIVES

-   Understand the role of the atmosphere and climate in sustaining life on Earth.
-   Understand how Earth's climate changed over time, and what makes it stable.
-   Understand the factors and the complexity behind modelling climate systems.
-   Learn about simple Energy Balance Models and discuss the assumptions behind the models.

#### PREAMBLE
<p style='text-align: justify;'>In this chapter, we will explore various energy balance models to try to simulate the climate on Earth. In particular, we are interested in simulating Earth's temperature and see how the various factors on Earth interplay with it. We will first understand Earth's temperature as a result of its distance from the Sun, following which we'll explore the importance of planetary atmospheres through the one-layer model. From the time evolution model, we are able to observe how Earth's temperature slowly equilibrates over time. Finally, we explore the different equilibrium states of planet Earth following changes in the Sun's luminosity.</p>

## 2 | INTRODUCTION

#### 2.1 THE ROLE OF EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE

<p style='text-align: justify;'>Earth's atmosphere is a thin layer of gas that surrounds the planet, mainly composed of nitrogen and oxygen. How the atmosphere interacts and responds to the components of the different subsystems shows how interconnected the environment is. For example, heat differences in the atmosphere caused by varying amounts of sunlight received drives wind movement, affecting ocean currents and precipitation distribution. Volcanic outgassing from the geosphere supplies the atmosphere with trace gases and carbon from Earth's interior. Life on Earth also modifies the composition of the atmosphere through respiration and photosynthesis. Hence, the atmosphere can be seen as a consequence of, and essential for, life (Lewis, 2020).</p>

#### 2.2 EARTH'S STABLE CLIMATE

![**Figure 1.** Evidence of the past: Zircons](https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2023/ancient-magma-reveals.jpg "Figure 1: Evidence of the past: Zircons"){width="50%"}
<p style='text-align: justify;'>The current earliest evidence of liquid water existing on Earth dates back to 4.4 billion years ago found in zircons. (Wilde et al., 2001) This suggests that Earth's temperature has remained in a narrow range that supports liquid water despite various changes, such as in the Sun's luminosity, throughout Earth's history. Climate stabilisation is vital for the security and continuity of Earth's inhabitants.</p>

#### 2.3 SDG 13: CLIMATE ACTION

<p style='text-align: justify;'>In recent years, a warming trend in the climate has drawn worldwide attention as it is proceeding at an unprecedented rate in Earth's history. It is especially significant as it is unambiguously a by-product of anthropogenic development since the 20th century. Scientists have documented evidence of this phenomenon across the globe that revealed a climate that is shifting. (NASA, n.d.)</p>

![**Figure 2.** Evidence of a changing climate. Adapted from NASA: Global Climate Change](Chapter1Media\Figure2.png "Figure 2: Evidence of a changing climate. Adapted from NASA: Global Climate Change"){width="100%"}

<p style='text-align: justify;'>What's concerning is how these changes have severely impacted our everyday lives. For example, extreme weather events have disrupted the provision of basic amenities such as water, sanitation and education in many countries, not to mention the large-scale infrastructure damages that follow these events. A change in global climate has also negatively impacted agricultural production and resulted in food security issues.</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>Under the push for global collaboration on sustainable development, the United Nations (UN) adopted 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). **Goal 13: Climate action** primarily aims to:</p>

1.  Improve the resilience and adaptability of all countries to climate-related hazards.
2.  Vitalize initiatives against climate change in national policies and planning.
3.  Emphasize education and develop institutional capacities on climate change resilience, adaptability, impact reduction and early warning.

## 3 | ENERGY BALANCE MODELS (EBMs)

<p style='text-align: justify;'>In the following chapters, we will understand Earth's climate by modelling it using Energy Balance Models (EBMs). These models are simple but very useful to investigate Earth's climate. They do not take into account the many dynamics of the climate (wind, atmospheric circulation, ocean currents or convection in oceans or atmosphere) but only focus on the energetics and thermodynamics of the climate system.</p>

**Table 1:** Four different EBMs to model Earth's temperature with increasing complexity
![](Chapter1Media\Table1.png){fig-align="center" width="100%"}

## 4 |  SIMPLE RADIATIVE EQUILIBRIUM WITH NO ATMOSPHERE
<p style='text-align: justify;'>Since Earth's temperature has been stable over a long geological time, Earth can be perceived to be in a state of radiative equilibrium. It is a state in which the total thermal radiation received by the object is equivalent to the total thermal radiation being emitted. In short, **the flow of incoming energy = the flow of outgoing energy** (**Figure 3**). Using this assumption, we can calculate the effective temperature of a planet at radiative equilibrium.</p>

![**Figure 3.** Incoming solar radiation (left) and outgoing Earth radiation (right)](Chapter1Media\Figure3.png){fig-align="center" width="80%"}  

<p style='text-align: justify;'>Although the energy of the geosphere is significant, most of the energy received on Earth important for life originates from the Sun (Incoming energy). The received energy then excites atoms and molecules on Earth, raising the temperature of the corresponding material and results in thermal infrared energy radiated (Outgoing energy). Let's now have a look at how we will be calculating the amount of energy received and emitted by a planet.</p>

#### 4.1 BLACKBODY RADIATION
<p style='text-align: justify;'>We can use the concept of blackbody radiation to model the Sun and also the Earth's flow of energy. A blackbody refers to a model system which absorbs all incident electromagnetic radiation and for it to remain in thermal equilibrium, it must emit radiation as well (blackbody radiation). The blackbody emission spectrum depends on the temperature of the object and follows **Planck's law**, **Wien's law** and the **Stefan-Boltzmann law**.</p>

##### (A) Planck's Law  
<p style='text-align: justify;'>Planck's law shows the electromagnetic spectral distribution of the radiation coming from a blackbody at a specific temperature in thermal equilibrium.</p>  
![**Figure 4:** (Left) Blackbody emission spectra of an object with increasing temperature (3000K to 6000K). (Right) Blackbody emission spectra of the Sun and the Earth](Chapter1Media\Figure4.png){fig-align="center" width="100%"}  

##### (B) Wien's Law 
<p style='text-align: justify;'>Wien's law gives you the relationship between the wavelength of the maximum emission and the temperature of the blackbody object.</p>

\begin{equation}
\tag{1}
\lambda_{max} = \frac{2898}{T}
\end{equation}

<p style='text-align: justify;'>To find the wavelength ($\lambda_{max}$, $\mu m$) of the maximum emission, divide 2898 by the temperature ($T$,$K$).</p>

##### (C) Stefan-Boltzmann Law
<p style='text-align: justify;'>The Stefan-Boltzmann Law gives you the flux of energy (the rate of transfer of energy per unit area) emitted by the blackbody object ($F$) at a specific temperature (for a perfect blackbody we have):</p>

\begin{equation}
\tag{2}
F = \sigma T^{4}
\end{equation}

<p style='text-align: justify;'>The flux ($F$, $W m^{-2}$) emitted is the product of the temperature ($T$, $K$) of the blackbody and the Stefan-Boltzmann constant ($\sigma = 5.67 * 10^{-8} W  m^{-2}  K^{-4}$).</p>

##### (D) Calculation of flux received at the surface of a planet  
<p style='text-align: justify;'>To calculate the amount of flux received on the surface of a planet from the star $S_{0}$, we have to utilise the inverse square law (**Figure 5**). It says that the energy density is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source, while the total energy emitted from the source is constant.</p>

![**Figure 5:** Illustration of energy dispersion through the inverse square law.](Chapter1Media\Figure5.jpg "Figure 5: Illustration of energy dispersion through the inverse square law."){width="80%"}  

\begin{equation}
\tag{3}
\frac{F}{S_{0}} = \frac{R_{p}^{2}}{r_{s}^{2}}
\end{equation}

<p style='text-align: justify;'>The ratio between the flux emitted from the surface of the sun ($F$, $W m^{-2}$)  and the flux received on a planet ($S_{0}$, $W m^{-2}$) equals the ratio between the square of the planet's distance from the sun ($R_{p}$, $m$) and the square of the Sun's radius ($r_{s}$, $m$).</p>

#### 4.2 ALBEDO

<p style='text-align: justify;'>Not all the light from the Sun is received by a planet, with one part being reflected off. The amount reflected depends on the albedo of the surface $\alpha$ (**Table 2**).</p>
 
\begin{equation}
\tag{4}
S_0' = S_0\alpha
\end{equation}

<p style='text-align: justify;'>The flux reflected by the planet ($S_0'$, $W m^{-2}$) is the product of the flux received by the planet ($S_0$, $W m^{-2}$) and its albedo ($\alpha$).</p>

**Table 2:** Albedo of various surfaces

![](Chapter1Media\Table2.png){fig-align="center" width="50%"}  

#### 4.3 EFFECTIVE TEMPERATURE OF A PLANET
<p style='text-align: justify;'>We are now able to calculate the effective temperature of a planet at radiative equilibrium. The planet absorbs the energy from the Sun (Solar flux, $S_0$) and emits radiation as a blackbody (Planet flux, $F_p$). The albedo ($\alpha$) is the fraction of light being reflected.</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>To convert flux to energy, we have to multiply it by its effective surface area (**Figure 6**). A planet intercepts incoming solar flux with its cross-sectional area $\pi R^2$. However, the planet flux is emitted over the entire spherical surface area of the planet of 4$\pi R^2$.</p>

![**Figure 6:** The effective surface areas of incoming solar flux and the planet flux](Chapter1Media\Figure6.png){fig-align="center" width="50%"}  


We can then derive the equation for a planet's temperature at energy balance equilibrium to be:

\begin{equation}
\tag{5}
T_{p} = \sqrt[4]{\frac{S_0(1-\alpha)}{4\sigma}}
\end{equation}

### **Exercise 1**  

Derive the equation for a planet's temperature at energy balance equilibrium:
$$T_{p} = \sqrt[4]{\frac{S_0(1-\alpha)}{4\sigma}}$$

**Hint:** Start from $E_{absorbed} = E_{emitted}$ 

### **Model Answer**  

$$E_{absorbed} = E_{emitted}$$
$$E_{received} - E_{reflected} = E_{emitted}$$
<p style='text-align: center;'>$S_0$ $*$ area of cross-section - $S_0$ $*$ $\alpha$ $*$ area of cross-section = $F_p$ $*$ Planet's surface area</p>
$$S_0 * \pi r_p^2 * (1 - \alpha) = \sigma T_p^4 * 4 \pi r_p^2$$
$$T_{p} = \sqrt[4]{\frac{S_0(1-\alpha)}{4\sigma}}$$

:::

## 5 |  ONE-LAYER MODEL
#### 5.1 GREENHOUSE GASES
<p style='text-align: justify;'>From the results of **M3**, a difference between the temperature modelled using your code and the actual temperature measured can be observed. This is because the simple radiative equilibrium model does not take planetary atmosphere into consideration. Although present in very small amounts in the atmosphere, some gases have a great impact on Earth's temperature. They are called greenhouse gases.</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>The greenhouse effect is the trapping of infra-red radiation by gases, resulting in an increase of the surface temperature. Infra-red active molecules show a change in their dipole moment (permanent dipole is not necessary) during vibration as seen in **Figure 7**.</p>

![**Figure 7:** Molecular vibrations of N<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O. You can view the animations [here](https://scied.ucar.edu/learning-zone/atmosphere/molecular-vibration-modes).](Chapter1Media\Figure7.png){fig-align="center" width="80%"}  

<p style='text-align: justify;'>Greenhouse gases absorb the infra-red radiation emitted by the solid Earth and re-emit them back into the atmosphere. **Figure 8** shows how much infra-red radiation emitted from the Earth is re-absorbed by the atmosphere. In particular, we can take note of the absorption bands of water and carbon dioxide.</p>

![**Figure 8:** The amount of greenhouse gas IR-absorption is shown in green and the Earth blackbody emitted radiation is shown in orange.](Chapter1Media\Figure8.png){fig-align="center" width="60%"}

<p style='text-align: justify;'>For **M3**, Venus has a thick atmosphere that is primarily comprised of CO<sub>2</sub> (around 96.5%). Hence, its strong greenhouse effect on Venus retains more heat in its atmosphere, resulting in the observed large temperature increment. In contrast, while Mars also has a predominantly CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere (around 95.32%), its atmosphere is really thin, and thus plays a relatively weak role in retaining heat. As such, the previous model can provide a close approximation to Mars' temperature.</p>

#### 5.2 ONE-LAYER MODEL
<p style='text-align: justify;'>The one-layer model is a simple model to show the effect of the atmosphere on a planet's temperature. **Figure 9** shows the solar radiation $F_s$ entering the atmosphere and only a fraction $\tau_s$ goes through and reaches the planet's surface. Similarly, the flux emitted by the planet surface $F_g$ comes out of the layer of atmosphere with a fraction $\tau_g$. The values for $\tau_s$ and $\tau_g$ are 0.8 and 0.1 respectively on Earth. Finally, $F_a$ represents the radiation emitted by the atmosphere (also modelled as a blackbody).</p>

![**Figure 9:** **Left**, One-layer model: $F_s$, $F_g$ and $F_a$ are respectively the emission from the sun, the Earth's surface and the atmosphere (with $\tau_s$ = 0.8 and $\tau_g$ = 0.1). **Right**, The blackbody emission spectrum of the sun and measured solar radiation before and after going through the atmosphere.](Chapter1Media\Figure9.png){fig-align="center" width="100%"}

::: panel-tabset

### **Exercise 2**  

What does $\tau_s$ and $\tau_g$ represent? Explain the difference in value.

### **Model Answer**  

<p style='text-align: justify;'>$\tau_s$ represents the fraction of solar flux going through the atmosphere. As the primary wavelengths of incoming solar energy is in the visible spectrum, and the atmosphere is not opaque to visible light, most of the solar flux is able to pass through, resulting in a high value of 0.8. 

On the contrary, $\tau_g$ represents the fraction of planet flux passing through the atmosphere into space. As the primary emissions are in the infra-red range allowing for greenhouse gas IR-absorption, not much of the emissions goes through the atmosphere, resulting in a low value of 0.1.</p>

:::

::: panel-tabset

### **Exercise 3**  

<p style='text-align: justify;'>Assume there is a radiative equilibrium both at the top of the atmosphere and at the surface of the Earth (bottom of the atmosphere), derive an expression for the flux emitted from the ground ($F_g$) as a function of $F_s$, $\tau_s$, $\tau_g$ (see **Figure 9**)</p>

### **Model Answer**  

At the top of the atmosphere:

$$F_s = F_a + F_g\tau_g$$
$$F_a = F_s - F_g\tau_g$$
At the bottom of the atmosphere:

$$F_s\tau_s + F_a = F_g$$
$$F_a = F_g - F_s\tau_s$$
Combining (1) and (2):

$$F_s - F_g\tau_g = F_g - F_s\tau_s$$
$$F_s(1+\tau_s) = F_g(1+\tau_g)$$
$$F_g = F_s\frac{(1+\tau_s)}{(1+\tau_g)}$$

### **Exercise 4**  

From the previous simplified equation in **Exercise 3**, derive the equation to calculate the effective temperature of the planet ($T_p$) with an atmosphere.

### **Model Answer**  

$$F_g = F_s\frac{(1+\tau_s)}{(1+\tau_g)}$$
$$\sigma T^4 * 4\pi R^2 = \frac{S_0 * \pi R^2 * (1-\alpha)*(1+\tau_s)}{(1+\tau_g)}$$
$$T = \sqrt[4]{\frac{S_0 * (1-\alpha)*(1+\tau_s)}{4\sigma(1+\tau_g)}}$$

## 6 | TEMPERATURE EVOLUTION MODEL
#### 6.1 EARTH AS A GREYBODY
So far, we have modelled the planet as a perfect blackbody and therefore the emitted flux Fg ($W m^{-2}$):

\begin{equation}
F_{g} = \epsilon\sigma * T^4 = \sigma * T^4
\end{equation}

<p style='text-align: justify;'>$\epsilon$ is the emissivity of the body. It varies from 0 (no emission) to 1 (perfect blackbody emission). A body with an emissivity less than 1 is called a greybody.</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>From the one-layer model, we see that the atmosphere affects a planet's surface temperature greatly through the introduction of $\tau$. Comparing it to the simple radiative equilibrium model which assumes the Earth as a perfect blackbody ($\epsilon$ = 1), we can find that it does not model well the real surface temperature.</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>In essence, due to the insulative blanket that the atmosphere causes, the emitted flux back to space will be lower. Hence, the emissivity of the body is lower and the surface temperature will be higher. By including the coefficient $\epsilon$, we can model better the real surface temperature. Note we cannot directly measure $\epsilon$, but we can adjust the value according to temperature and flux observations.</p>

#### 6.2 TEMPERATURE LINEARISATION
<p style='text-align: justify;'>In order to make the modelling easier, we'll be doing temperature linearisation (possible because $T_c$ = $\pm$ 20$^\circ$C). Sellers (1969) and Budyko (1969) in the 60's demonstrated that Earth's energy emission could be written in a linear form with the temperature. Much later, it was proven to fit very well with energy flux observations.</p>

Since for small $x$, we can write $(1+x)^4 \approx 1 + 4x$

$$T_K^4 = (T_0 + T_c)^4 = T_0^4 * (1 + \frac{T_c}{T_0})^4 \approx T_0^4 * (1+4\frac{T_c}{T_0})$$
The temperature in Kelvin ($T_K$), the 0$^\circ$C in Kelvin ($T_0$ = 273.15K) and temperature in Celcius ($T_c$)

$${T_K}^4 = {T_0}^4 + 4{T_0}^3 * T_c = a + bT_c$$

As $a$ and $b$ are constants, we can simplify:

\begin{equation}
\tag{6}
F_g = \epsilon\sigma * {T_K}^4 = \epsilon\sigma(a + bT_c) = A + BT_c
\end{equation}

<p style='text-align: justify;'>With A ($W m^{-2}$) and B ($W m^{-2}$ $^\circ C$) constants. A and B reflect the **emissivity** of the atmosphere. They will be given and they vary with the type of atmosphere (amount of greenhouse gases). More or less, the constants A and B can tell us the following:</p>

## Modelling Questions

**M5.** Recalling what the linearisation constants (A and B) stand for, translate the equations into code and calculate the temperature of Earth using the constants from McGuffie (2005).
:::

#### 6.3 TEMPERATURE EVOLUTION MODEL
<p style='text-align: justify;'>In this model, we are interested to find the change of temperature with time and find the equilibrium temperature of the planet as it reaches radiative equilibrium. We will be modelling Earth's emission as written in *5.2* using the values for a greybody. Thus, the equations for Earth's average energy gain ($E_{gain}$) and energy loss ($E_{loss}$) for this model would be:</p>

$$E_{gain} = S_0* (1-\alpha)*\pi r^2$$
$$E_{loss} = (A + BT_c) * 4\pi r^2$$
Removing the common terms and divide both terms by 4, we'll get:

$$E_{gain} = \frac{S_0* (1-\alpha)}{4}$$
$$E_{loss} = A + BT_c$$

<p style='text-align: justify;'>The absorption of heat of a body is controlled by the heat capacity (C). So, the difference between the energy gain and the energy loss of the Earth can be expressed:</p>

\begin{equation}
\tag{7}
C * \frac{dT}{dt} = E_{gain} - E_{loss}
\end{equation}

The rate of heat flow ($\frac{dT}{dt}$) is proportional to the difference between the energy gained and energy loss by Earth.

## Modelling Questions

Let's construct a code for a temperature evolution model that simulates how Earth's temperature slowly equilibrates over time.


**M6.** Calculate Earth's Heat Capacity ($C$) based on Earth's water content. Given:  
<br /> Depth of water: $70$ m
<br /> Density of water: $1.025 * 10^6$ g/m$^3$
<br /> Heat capacity of water: $4.186$ J/g$*$K
<br /> Ocean coverage: $0.7$

**M7.** Calculate Earth's average $E_{gain}$ (Energy gain in Watts/m$^2$). Given:  
<br /> $S_0$: 1370 Watts/m$^2$
<br /> Albedo: 0.32

**M8.** Based on the final equation from **5.3**, use the Euler method to simulate Earth's temperature slowly equilibrating over time from a given initial temperature. After each iteration, store the temperature (**T**) and the time (**t**) in a list to be plotted at the end. 

![](Chapter1Media\Plot1.jpg){fig-align="center" width="80%"}

Here are some variables you can consider initializing at the start of the model:
<br /> *Count*: To keep track of the number of loops
<br /> *Starting temperature* (T_0): 255 K
<br /> *Starting time* (t_0): 0 seconds
<br /> *Timestep or dt*: 1 Year or 31536000 seconds
<br /> Two lists to store the time and temperature from each iteration

## 7 | THE PUSH OVER THE EDGE
#### 7.1 TIPPING POINTS

<p style='text-align: justify;'>In a climate system, tipping points are what climatologists refer to as vulnerable areas that when triggered, could result in a climate emergency with irreversible consequences (Lenton et al., 2019). Examples of tipping points often being discussed include the melting of the arctic sea ice, deforestation in the Amazon basin and widescale coral bleaching events. Following the recent trend of global warming, climatologists are now concerned of the risk of a cascade of tipping points crossing their critical thresholds, leading to severe repercussions on the climate, our ecosystems and our societies (Wunderling et al., 2021).</p>

![**Figure 10:** Significant tipping points hypothesized and the cascading connections between them.](https://i.cbc.ca/1.5378521.1575051684!/fileImage/httpImage/raising-the-alarm-climate-tipping-points.jpg "Figure 10: Significant tipping points hypothesized and the cascading connections between them."){fig-align="center" width="80%"}

#### 7.2 FEEDBACK LOOPS
<p style='text-align: justify;'>To understand climate tipping points, let's first try to imagine how Earth's climate would be like given the following situations:</p>

::: panel-tabset

### **Exercise 5**  

What would happen to the Earth if it experiences an extreme increase of solar insolation? Predict the changes using the water vapor feedback mechanism (**Figure 11**). Explain the mechanism of this feedback. Does it happen easily? Why?  
(Think of the relationship between pressure and the boiling point, **Figure 12**)

![**Figure 11:** Water vapor feedback.](Chapter1Media\Figure11.png){fig-align="center" width="100%"} 

![**Figure 12:** The phase diagram of water.](Chapter1Media\Figure12.png){fig-align="center" width="50%"}


### **Model Answer**  

From the water vapor feedback mechanism, when Earth experiences an extreme increase of solar insolation, the temperature on Earth would increase, causing more water evaporation to occur on Earth. As water vapor is a greenhouse gas, it would result in the further retainment of heat in the atmosphere, leading to increasing temperatures on Earth. Hence, it is viewed as a positive feedback loop.    

However, it doesn't happen easily as when there is an increase of water vapor in the air, it results in a higher atmospheric pressure which increases the boiling point of water. As such, the amount of evaporation would reduce. This counter-mechanism helps mediate the water vapor feedback.

::: panel-tabset

### **Exercise 6**  

What would happen to the Earth if it experiences an extreme decrease in solar insolation? Predict the changes using the Ice-albedo feedback mechanism (**Figure 13**). Explain the mechanism of this feedback. 

![**Figure 13:** Ice-albedo feedback.](Chapter1Media\Figure13.png){fig-align="center" width="100%"}  

### **Model Answer**  

Following the ice-albedo feedback loop, if Earth experiences an extreme decrease in solar insolation, Earth's temperature would reduce. As a result, the ice caps would extend to lower latitudes from the poles. An increase in polar ice caps results in an increase in planetary albedo, which leads to a reduced amount of energy entering Earth's climate system. This then further causes a reduction in temperature, completing the positive feedback loop.

<p style='text-align: justify;'>In this final climate model, we will compute the equilibrium temperatures of the Earth following the Ice-albedo model when:</p>

1. The solar luminosity is increasing
2. The solar luminosity is decreasing
3. Ice is forming

<p style='text-align: justify;'>In our previous models, we have kept the albedo of the planet constant. Now, we will vary the albedo of the planet through the simulation of ice forming on the planet, which in turn is affected by the temperature.</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>This model takes into account the contribution of each latitude (surface area and local temperature) to calculate the average temperature of Earth.</p>

The objectives are:

1. Generate the temperature data for a range of solar radiation (*luminosity*).
2. Plot the graph T (*temperature*) against M (*solar multiplier*)

#### 8.2 MODEL SET-UP
##### (A) Energy gain

![**Figure 15:** Distribution of the solar flux across latitudes.](Chapter1Media\Figure14.png){fig-align="center" width="100%"}  

We divide the hemisphere in 10 bands of 9$^\circ$ latitude each (**Figure 14**). The area of each band (in fraction) and the local solar flux ($S_i$) is reported in **Table 5**.

**Table 5:** Area and local solar flux received for each latitude bands.

![](Chapter1Media\Table5.png){fig-align="center" width="100%"} 

Use the zonal insolation data ($S_i$) to calculate $F_{gain}$ at each latitude band.

\begin{equation}
\tag{8}
F_{gain} = S_i * (1-\alpha_i) * M
\end{equation}

##### (B) Temperature
Let's define the average planet temperature as:

\begin{equation}
\tag{9}
T_{avg} = \sum(area_i * T_i)
\end{equation}

##### (C) Energy loss from Earth
<p style='text-align: justify;'>The energy emitted/lost at each latitude band is given by the local temperature ($T_i$) and the average temperature ($T_{avg}$):</p>

\begin{equation}
\tag{10}
F_{loss} = A + B * T_i + G * (T_i - T_{avg})
\end{equation}

G represents heat transfer coefficient. $F_{loss}$ at each latitude band is then calculated.

#### 8.3 LOCAL AND AVERAGE ALBEDO
<p style='text-align: justify;'>Let's now find the local albedo ($\alpha_i$). At each latitude band, the albedo is fixed at 0.3 (current Earth's albedo) when the temperature is $\ge -10^\circ$C (critical T), otherwise it is 0.6 (ice albedo). The same way as the temperature, the average albedo of the planet is the sum of the area-weighted albedos.</p>

\begin{equation}
\tag{11}
\alpha_{average} = \sum(area_i * \alpha_i)
\end{equation}

#### 8.4 EQUILIBRIUM STATES
<p style='text-align: justify;'>Our objective is to find the equilibrium average temperature of the planet for a specific solar luminosity ($T_{eq}$ against $M$). In other words, how does the planet's temperature change when the overall solar energy received changes.</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>You'll need to find the average temperature (T) at equilibrium for the values of the solar multiplier ($M$) going from 0.6 to 1.4. First, run the model by increasing $M$ (0.6 to 1.4) and then by decreasing $M$ (1.4 to 0.6). Collect the equilibrium temperature for each solar multiplier.</p>

$$F_{loss} = A + B * T_i + G * (T_i - T_{avg})$$
$$F_{gain} = S_i * (1-\alpha_i) * M$$

At equilibrium, $F_{gain} = F_{loss}$

$$F_{gain} = F_{loss} = A + B * T_i + G * (T_i - T_{avg})$$

\begin{equation}
\tag{12}
T_i = \frac{F_{gain} - A + G * T_{avg}}{(B+G)}
\end{equation}

<p style='text-align: justify;'>To find the equilibrium average planet temperature ($T_{avg}$), you will start with an arbitrary condition (i.e. local temperature for each latitude band) and use the iteration method.</p>

#### 8.5 INITIAL CONDITIONS
The solar constant is $S_0 * M$ with $M$ ranging from 0.6 to 1.4.

<p style='text-align: justify;'>You will assume that it is the same initial temperature ($T_i$ = 255K) at each latitude band (with $M$ = 0.6). Therefore, all local albedos at the initial stage is equivalent to 0.6 (Earth is covered in ice).</p>

## Modelling Questions

Let's construct a code to understand the ice-albedo model.

You are given two arrays containing the area of each band and its local solar flux:

```
# Array containing area of each band and its local solar flux
Area = np.array([0.156434465, 0.152582529, 0.144973505, 0.133794753, 0.119321529, 0.101910213, 0.08198953, 0.060049992, 0.036631824, 0.012311659])
S    = np.array([416.6480383, 406.3887808, 386.1228828, 356.349358, 317.8013293, 271.4279772, 218.3711674, 160.4091221, 112.7543514, 73.14499959])

# Constants:
G, A, B = 3.8, 204, 2.17
```

**M9.** Initialize two arrays to store the modelled Earth's bands of temperatures (*T_0*) and albedos(*albedo_0*). *Have the planet first be -70$^\circ$C throughout.*

**Remember:** The critical temperature is $-10^\circ$C, albedo is 0.3 $\ge -10^\circ$C and albedo is 0.6 $\le -10^\circ$C.

#### 8.6 UNDERSTANDING THE GRAPH

<p style='text-align: justify;'>The ice-albedo model aims to relate the concept of feedback cycles and how they affect the surface temperature of the Earth to achieve equilibrium. In **Exercise 7**, attempt to draw the feedback cycles when surface temperatures drops or when it rises. You'll find that both feedback cycles show a positive feedback loop which magnifies the effects of the change in solar luminosity.</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>The ice-albedo model show how changes of the Earth's polar ice caps can have huge effects on the entire planet's climate. For more information, look into the supplementary materials on Earth's paleoclimate.</p>

### **Exercise 7**  

Illustrate two positive feedback loops when **1.** surface temperatures drops and **2.** when surface temperature rises incorporating the below factors:

- Surface temperature
- Ice Cover
- Earth's albedo
- $F_{gain}$

### **Model Answer**

:::

<p style='text-align: justify;'>However, why does the surface temperature trend go differently depending on the increasing or decreasing of the solar luminosity? This phenomenon is a hysteresis. Hysteresis is the dependence of the state of a system on its initial conditions. So, how were the initial conditions different that could help to explain the hysteresis observed in the graph plot of equilibrium temperature against $M$?</p>
